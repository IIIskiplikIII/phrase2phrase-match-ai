I used a different approach there and this version is a recap of everything**\n","\n","Hi visitor,\n","this is my first NLP project and my first competition on Kaggle. I am familliar with the theoretical basics of NLP but never did a project on this topics especially with some pretrained models. So this is it. \n","\n","In this project I first tried two approaches of pre-trained model. One where I load the pre-trained model manually in the embeddings layer and use that layer as a part of my model (glove) and the other one based on Huggingfaces🤗 framework, where I use the from_pretrained() function which loads the whole model (with all layers). This can be found in the notebook version where I submitted the competition with, which is version 14.\n","The current version/approach of the notebook is just the Huggingface🤗 edition because this makes all of this more readable and easier to understand 😁\n","\n","HINT - After the Competition:\n","For a better learning process I recaped my work and compared it with other competitions contributors work. One main notebook here was Jeremy Howards \"Iterate like a grandmaster!\" as well as the notebook of Mohamad Merchant who also wrote a blog article about \"Semantic Similarity with BERT\" on Keras, which handles the use of NLP models on Keras. The notebook which I got a lot inspired on can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/mohamadmerchant/us-phrase-matching-tf-keras-train-tpu. \n","I used a lot of bothes approaches in this notebook in the recap phase. Once again: If you want to see my initial approach where I got around 70% accuracy you should take a look at version 14. This was the version that I submitted to the competition. All work after this version is part of the recap phase and therefore full of inspiring code parts of other contributors.\n","\n","I thereforce ask you to bear with?! 🤗"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.02074,"end_time":"2022-06-21T07:11:02.063820","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-06-21T07:11:02.043080","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Imports and Datasets"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":35,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-25T04:13:44.530424Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-25T04:13:44.529976Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-25T04:13:44.562193Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-25T04:13:44.561445Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-25T04:13:44.530383Z"},"papermill":{"duration":14.449925,"end_time":"2022-06-21T07:11:16.534173","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-06-21T07:11:02.084248","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["import sys\n","assert sys.version_info >= (3,5)\n","import os\n","import pathlib\n","\n","# Is this notebook running on Colab or Kaggle?\n","IS_COLAB = \"google.colab\" in sys.modules\n","IS_KAGGLE = \"kaggle_secrets\" in sys.modules\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","from scipy import stats\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from functools import partial\n","import seaborn as sns\n","from datasets import Dataset\n","from datasets import DatasetDict\n","\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import Normalizer\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n","from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\n","\n","import nltk\n","from string import punctuation\n","from collections import Counter\n","\n","from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine\n","\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","from tensorflow import keras\n","import tensorflow_datasets as tfds\n","from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\n","from keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences\n","from keras import layers\n","from keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense, Dropout, CuDNNLSTM, Bidirectional\n","from keras.layers.merge import concatenate\n","from transformers import TrainingArguments\n","from transformers import BertTokenizer, TFDebertaModel\n","from transformers import RobertaTokenizer, TFRobertaModel, TFRobertaForSequenceClassification\n","from transformers import TFAutoModel\n","\n","#import mlflow\n","#from mlflow import log_metric, log_param, log_artifacts\n","#import mlflow.tensorflow\n","#from mlflow import pyfunc\n","\n","assert tf.__version__ >= \"2.0\"\n","\n","print(f\"Tensorflow Version: {tf.__version__}\")\n","print(f\"Keras Version: {keras.__version__}\")\n","\n","if not tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'):\n","    print(\"No GPU was detected.
